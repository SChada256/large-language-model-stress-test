🏎️ AI & LLM Benchmarking Tools (2026 Edition)
Before you try to run the Ultra Stress Tests, you need to know your hardware's limits. Use these tools to measure your Tokens Per Second (TPS), VRAM usage, and thermal efficiency.

🐧 Linux (The Power User Choice)
Linux offers the most "raw" access to GPU kernels, typically yielding 5-10% better performance for Ollama.

Ollama-Benchmark (obench): A simple bash script by Jeff Geerling that runs a standard set of models and outputs a clean Markdown table of your TPS.
nvtop: The "htop" for GPUs. Essential for monitoring VRAM spikes while running large models like Llama 4 or DeepSeek V3.
vLLM Benchmark Suite: If you are moving past Ollama into production-grade serving, use vLLM's internal benchmarking scripts to test throughput and latency.
🍏 macOS (Apple Silicon / Metal)
Macs are the kings of "Unified Memory," allowing you to run massive models (70B+) that would normally require $4,000 GPUs.

LM Studio (Built-in): Includes a "Hardware Monitor" and a "Developer Lab" that gives real-time stats on Metal GPU utilization.
Ollama Monitor (Menu Bar): A lightweight utility to keep track of which models are currently residing in your RAM/VRAM.
MLPerf Client: The industry standard. The 2026 version (v1.5+) has specific optimizations for the M4/M5 Ultra chips to test sustained AI workloads.
🪟 Windows (The Gaming & NPU Tier)
Windows 11 in 2026 is heavily optimized for "AI PCs" with dedicated NPUs (Neural Processing Units).

Geekbench AI: Formerly Geekbench ML. This is the best cross-platform tool to compare your NPU vs. your GPU performance.
NVIDIA ChatRTX: While not a benchmark tool itself, it includes a performance overlay specifically for RTX 50-series cards.
Ollama Benchmark Tool (GUI): A Streamlit-based web app that detects your Windows GPU, pulls models automatically, and generates Plotly charts of your performance.
📊 Standardized Model Tiers for Testing
When reporting your results in this repo, please use these "Hardware Tiers" as a reference:

Tier	Hardware Example	Recommended Model Size
Budget	8GB VRAM / 16GB RAM	1B - 3B (Gemma 3, Phi-4)
Mid-Range	16GB VRAM / 32GB RAM	7B - 14B (Llama 4 Scout, Mistral)
Enthusiast	24GB+ VRAM / 64GB RAM	30B - 70B (Qwen 3, DeepSeek R1)
Workstation	128GB+ Unified Memory (Mac)	100B+ (Llama 4 Maverick, GPT-OSS)
🚀 Quick Start: The "1-Minute" Benchmark
If you have Ollama installed, run this command in your terminal to get an instant speed reading:

# On Linux/Mac
curl -s [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geerlingguy/ai-benchmarks/master/obench.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geerlingguy/ai-benchmarks/master/obench.sh) | bash

# On Windows (PowerShell)
# Use the LLM-Benchmark Python tool
pip install llm-benchmark
llm_benchmark run
