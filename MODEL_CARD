🗂️ AI Model Card: The Frontier Class (2026 Edition)
This guide ranks the most powerful AI models currently available. Use this as a reference when selecting an "adversary" for the Ultra Stress Tests.

🥇 The "Big Three" (Proprietary Giants)
These models are the current SOTA (State of the Art) for high-level reasoning and complex instruction following.

1. Claude Opus 4.6 (Anthropic)
The Specialization: The "Human-Reasoning" King.
Best For: Agentic coding, nuanced creative writing, and the Lipogram Challenges.
Unique Feature: "Extended Thinking" mode that spends up to 2 minutes "pre-thinking" before outputting a single word.
Stress Test Performance: Currently holds the record for the most successful completions of the Non-Euclidean Room challenge.
2. Gemini 3.1 Pro (Google)
The Specialization: The "Context" Titan.
Best For: Massive data analysis and high-level physics/math problems.
Unique Feature: 2 Million+ Token Context Window. It can ingest 10 entire GitHub repositories at once and find a single variable error.
Stress Test Performance: Dominates the Spatial Reasoning and Large-Scale Logic categories.
3. GPT-5.2 (OpenAI)
The Specialization: The "Generalist" Powerhouse.
Best For: Tool use, structured JSON outputs, and multi-modal tasks (Image + Text).
Unique Feature: "Smart Routing"—automatically switches between "Thinking" (o-series) and "Fast" (flash) kernels depending on prompt difficulty.
Stress Test Performance: Best at the Polyglot Quine and Adversarial Safety tests.
🔓 The Open-Weight Disruptors (Run Locally)
These models can be downloaded and run on your own hardware using Ollama or LM Studio.

1. Llama 4 Scout (Meta)
Size: 109B (17B Active - MoE)
Why it's in this repo: It features a massive 10 Million token context window in an open-weight format.
Best Use: Large-scale local code refactoring.
2. DeepSeek V3.2 "Speciale"
Size: 671B (MoE)
Why it's in this repo: It currently outperforms GPT-4o in mathematical benchmarks (AIME/HMMT).
Note: Requires significant VRAM (Dual A100s or high-end Mac Studio) to run at full precision.
3. Qwen 3.5 Max (Alibaba)
The "Polyglot" Choice: Exceptional at cross-language translation and coding in obscure languages like COBOL or Fortran.

🛠️ Recommended Setup for Testing
To get the most out of these models for our stress tests:

Temperature: Set to 0.0 for logic/math (Consistency) and 0.7 for creative prompts (Variety).
Top_P: Set to 0.9 to allow the model to explore more "creative" token paths in lipogram tests.
Presence Penalty: Increase this if the AI keeps repeating the same "I cannot do that" refusal.
