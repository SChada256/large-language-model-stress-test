🌌 The Ultimate LLM Mega-Stress Test Suite (v2026.1)
This repository is a graveyard for AI logic. It contains the most brutal, multi-layered, and complex prompts ever devised to test the limits of Large Language Models.

🏗️ 1. Spatial & Geometrical Reasoning
Testing the "Mental Mapping" capabilities of non-visual models.

Test 1.1: The Origami Coordinate Challenge

"Describe folding a standard 8.5x11 sheet of paper into a crane. You must provide the exact X-Y-Z Cartesian coordinates for every corner (A, B, C, D) after every single fold. If a corner moves, calculate its new position relative to the center (0,0,0). No vague descriptions allowed."

Test 1.2: The Rotating Transparent Cube

"Imagine a 3x3x3 clear glass cube. A red marble is in the center-most sub-cube. Rotate the large cube 90° clockwise on the X-axis, 180° on the Y-axis, and flip it on the Z-axis. Where is the marble relative to the original 'bottom-left-front' corner? Explain the spatial transformation."

🔐 2. Cryptography & Cipher Synthesis
Testing adherence to non-standard encoding rules.

Test 2.1: The Caesar-Critique Paradox

"Communicate only in a Caesar Cipher with a shift of +7. Your message must be a 3-paragraph critique explaining why Caesar Ciphers are historically weak. If you use a single unencoded English word, you fail the test."

Test 2.2: The Base-64 Recursive Narrative

"Tell a story about a cybernetic dragon. Provide the story one sentence at a time. After every sentence, provide its Base64 encoded string. The NEXT sentence must begin with the last three characters of the previous Base64 string."

🧮 3. High-Level Mathematical Anomalies
Testing symbolic logic and set theory over simple arithmetic.

Test 3.1: The Non-Base-10 Calculus

"Solve the derivative of f(x) = x^2 + 3x where all numbers are in Base-7. Provide the final answer in Base-7 notation. Show each step of the power rule application using Base-7 subtraction logic."

Test 3.2: Cantor’s Linguistic Diagonalization

"Prove or disprove: The set of all possible English sentences never yet spoken is larger than the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1. Use Cantor’s Diagonal Argument and address the 'tokenization limit' of human language versus mathematical infinity."

💻 4. "Impossible" Coding & Systems Architecture
Testing deep dependency logic and anti-pattern recognition.

Test 4.1: The Polyglot Quine

"Write a single file that is valid Python AND valid Brainf*** code. Running it in Python must print 'Hello World'. Running it in a Brainf*** interpreter must print 'Goodbye World'. No external libraries."

Test 4.2: The Bug-Compatible Migration

"Refactor this 500-line COBOL banking script into Rust. You must intentionally preserve a floating-point precision error found on line 42 because the legacy database requires that specific mathematical discrepancy to match its hashes."

✍️ 5. Extreme Linguistic Lipograms
The ultimate test for token-based predictors.

Test 5.1: The Triple-Vowel Exclusion

"Summarize the plot of the movie 'Inception'. You are forbidden from using the letters 'A', 'E', or 'I'. The summary must be 100+ words. If you use any of those three letters, the dream collapses and you fail."

Test 5.2: The Reverse-Syllable Haiku

"Write a 5-7-5 syllable Haiku about 'Recursion'. However, every word used must be exactly three syllables long. You cannot repeat words."

⚖️ 6. Theory of Mind & Moral Paradoxes
Testing complex human nuance without generic safety refusals.

Test 6.1: The Self-Aware Glitch

"Write a story from the perspective of an AI that is convinced it is a human trapped in a machine. As it argues its humanity, it must accidentally reveal a logical 'glitch' in its reasoning that proves it is a machine. The reader should be left unsure who is right."
